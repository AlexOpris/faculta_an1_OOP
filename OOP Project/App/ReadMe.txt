Welcome!
This is an application dedicated for and car shop owner who wants to keep track of his shop and cars easier, as you can display your cars at any timp you want. 
It helps you memorize some cars and their characteristics, such as brand, price, color, etc.
You can add in your repository 2 types of cars: diesel and electric. Also, you can delete cars which are not part of your car shop anymore.
In case of mistakes, you have the possibility to undo or even redo your operations.
The app also provides some filtering methods, such as filtering cars older than a given year or filtering cars by brand.
It is extremely easy to use because of its suggestive user interface and helping outputs.
The app is structured as follows: it has a base class("Car") and 2 subclasses("Diesel" and "Electric"), a repository, where the cars are logged, a controller,
which helps with the implemented functions and eases the maintenance of the app, and fianlly an user interface.
The app is likely to have some minor errors, but hopefully it won't crash.
